# Loan Application Process Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the loan application processes from two branches of a financial institution. The goal of the analysis is to compare the processes, identify key differences, and suggest potential improvements based on the data from two event logs. The analysis was almost completely done with **ProM** and only the preliminary analysis was done with **Python** using the **PM4Py** library. 

## Project Description

The project is divided into three main sections:
1. **Process Discovery**: Mining and visualizing models of the loan application process for both branches.
2. **Conformance Checking**: Identifying deviations and unexpected behaviors between the two processes.
3. **Process Improvement**: Suggesting potential improvements based on the analysis and conformance checking.

The analysis was performed using real-world event logs (L1 and L2). The logs include data on loan applications, offers, and workflows, with each log entry representing a change in the applicationâ€™s state.

## PDF Report

A detailed report outlining the full analysis, including methods, findings, and suggestions for improvements, can be found in the [**Loan Application Process Analysis Report**](./Report%20of%20Loan%20Process.pdf). This report includes visualizations, statistical analysis, and recommendations.
