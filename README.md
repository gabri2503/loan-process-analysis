## Introduction

In this report, we analyze your loan application process and provide various insights into the process. We present numerical data, different models, and deviations discovered during the analysis. 

The report distinguishes between two branches:
- **Branch 1**: Allows both online and in-bank applications for a loan and uses a different information system.
- **Branch 2**: Does not support online applications and has fewer event attributes.

Despite these differences, the two branches share several similarities, which are thoroughly examined in this report.
